A stunning premium passport book dramatically open, floating slightly above a glossy white surface with a soft reflection. The dark navy leather cover (#1A1A2E) has luxurious gold (#C9A961) embossed ornate borders with intricate patterns.

On the passport cover, prominently display the PassportCard logo (the red logo I'm uploading) embossed in gold with a subtle shine effect - make it the focal point of the cover.

The cream pages (#FDF8F0) are filled with MANY colorful achievement stamps that appear to GLOW and SPARKLE - stamps featuring golden trophies with shine effects, red (#E10514) handshake icons, green checkmarks with halos, star badges, and celebration ribbons. Some stamps have subtle golden sparkle particles floating around them.

Small golden confetti pieces and light particles are scattered in the air around the passport. Dramatic studio lighting creates depth with warm highlights and soft shadows. The overall mood is celebratory, premium, and exciting - like winning an award.

Professional product photography, cinematic lighting, shallow depth of field with bokeh in background, 16:9 aspect ratio, 8K quality render.

1. **Always upload the logo** as an attachment with each prompt
2. **Specify 16:9 aspect ratio** for video compatibility
3. **Include color hex codes** (#E10514, #C9A961, etc.) for brand accuracy
4. **Request RTL/Hebrew** text direction when showing UI
5. **Regenerate if needed** - Gemini may need 2-3 tries for perfect results
