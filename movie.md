## 4. Four Video Segments - Detailed Prompts

---

### 🎬 SEGMENT 1: THE CONCEPT (0-7 seconds)

#### Visual Concept
Introduce the passport metaphor and the excitement of gamification.

#### Scene Breakdown
```
0:00-0:02 → Close-up of passport cover with logo
0:02-0:04 → Passport opens, revealing stamps
0:04-0:06 → Zoom into glowing stamp
0:06-0:07 → Transition to smartphone screen
```

#### Primary Veo 3 Prompt

```
A premium cinematic shot of a sophisticated digital passport with PassportCard corporate branding. The passport cover is deep navy blue (#004C99) with an embossed metallic logo in silver and orange (#FF6B35) accents. Professional studio lighting creates subtle shadows and highlights on the textured leather-like surface.

The camera slowly orbits the passport as it elegantly opens, revealing pristine cream-colored pages filled with colorful, glowing achievement stamps. Each stamp features unique icons - a handshake, a checkmark, a trophy - rendered in blues, oranges, and gold tones. The stamps have a magical subtle glow effect.

One central stamp illuminates brighter with a soft golden aura. The camera smoothly zooms into this stamp, which transforms with particle effects into a modern iPhone 15 screen displaying a clean, minimalist app interface in PassportCard brand colors.

Style: High-end corporate video production, shallow depth of field, professional color grading with warm undertones, premium fintech aesthetic, smooth cinematic motion at 60fps. Shot on virtual cinema camera with bokeh effects. 4K quality.
```

#### Alternative Prompt (If first doesn't work well)

```
Product photography style video of an elegant passport book. Navy blue cover with orange and silver PassportCard logo. The passport sits on a clean white surface with professional studio lighting creating soft shadows.

Smooth animation: the passport opens by itself revealing pages with colorful stamp designs. Camera pushes in slowly. One stamp in the center glows gold and the camera zooms closer. The stamp expands and morphs into a smartphone screen.

Clean, modern, corporate aesthetic. Professional commercial quality. Bright lighting. Premium materials. Seamless transitions. 30fps, 1080p.
```

#### Shot Notes
- **Lighting:** Soft key light from 45° angle

- **Color temperature:** Warm (3500K-4500K)

0:02-0:04 → Scrolling through job positions
0:04-0:05 → Tap to share referral link
0:05-0:07 → Split screen: WhatsApp sharing + notification received
```

#### Primary Veo 3 Prompt

```
A professional corporate video showcasing a modern smartphone app experience. The scene opens with a hand holding an iPhone 15 Pro displaying the PassportCard Refer app. The app interface is clean and minimal with Hebrew text (right-to-left), featuring PassportCard blue (#0066CC) navigation bar and orange (#FF6B35) action buttons.

A finger elegantly taps and scrolls through a list of job position cards. Each card has a clean white background with blue accents, showing job titles in Hebrew, department tags, and prominent orange "המלץ עכשיו" (Refer Now) buttons.

The user taps a share button, triggering a smooth animation. The screen transitions to a split-screen view: LEFT side shows the WhatsApp green interface with the referral link being shared; RIGHT side shows another phone receiving a notification popup with PassportCard branding.

Both phones feature subtle float animation and glow effects. The background is a clean gradient from white to light blue. Professional hands visible, modern office desk setting with laptop partially visible in soft focus.

Style: Apple product video aesthetic, smooth 60fps animations, perfect UI clarity, professional commercial lighting, shallow depth of field on background, premium tech company production quality. Shot in 4K with attention to UI legibility.
```

#### Alternative Prompt (Simpler version)

```
Close-up video of hands using a smartphone with a referral app. The app has a blue and orange color scheme with Hebrew interface. 

The user scrolls through job listings, taps on one, then taps a share button. Animation shows the screen splitting in two - one phone sending, one phone receiving a message notification.

Clean modern office desk background (blurred). Bright professional lighting. Smooth UI animations. Easy to follow. Corporate tech video style. 1080p, 30fps.
```

#### Shot Notes
- **Focus:** Keep UI text legible
- **Hands:** Professional manicured hands, neutral skin tone
- **Background:** Subtle, doesn't distract from phones
- **Pacing:** Not too fast - let viewers understand the flow

---

### 🎬 SEGMENT 3: TRACKING & TRANSPARENCY (14-21 seconds)

#### Visual Concept
Demonstrate the tracking dashboard and gamification elements coming to life.

#### Scene Breakdown
```

0:02-0:04 → Status badges updating with animation
0:03-0:05 → Digital passport appearing with stamps
0:05-0:07 → Celebration: confetti + success animation
```

#### Primary Veo 3 Prompt

```
A dynamic and energetic video showcasing a laptop screen displaying the PassportCard Refer dashboard. The MacBook Pro screen shows a sophisticated analytics interface with clean data visualization in PassportCard brand colors.

The dashboard features:
- Hebrew text labels (right-aligned)
- Three status cards with animated progress bars in blue (#0066CC)
- Status badges that smoothly transition colors: blue (נשלח/Submitted) → orange (ראיון/Interview) → green (#00C853) (התקבל/Hired)
- Clean charts and metrics with smooth counting animations

As status changes, a translucent 3D digital passport materializes in the foreground with elegant particle effects. The passport pages flip open automatically revealing colorful achievement stamps appearing one by one with satisfying "pop" animations and golden sparkle effects.

When the final stamp appears (marking a successful hire), celebration confetti in PassportCard blue and orange colors bursts across the screen with joyful particle physics. The stamps glow with achievement aura.

Camera angle: Slight overhead view of laptop on modern white desk, professional depth of field on background. Lighting: Bright, professional office environment with natural window light. Production style: High-end SaaS product demo video, smooth 60fps animations, premium corporate aesthetic, engaging but professional. 4K quality.
```

#### Alternative Prompt (More focused)

```
Laptop screen showing a dashboard with charts and metrics in blue and orange colors. Hebrew text visible. Progress bars fill up smoothly. Status badges change from blue to orange to green with nice animations.

A 3D passport graphic appears floating above the laptop with cool hologram effect. The passport opens and stamps appear one by one on its pages. Each stamp has a little shine animation.

When all stamps appear, colorful confetti (blue and orange) explodes across the screen celebrating success.

Clean modern office setting. Professional lighting. Engaging animations but not cartoonish. Corporate video style. 1080p, 30fps.
```

#### Shot Notes
- **Dashboard:** Keep data readable but don't focus on specific numbers
- **Passport effect:** Semi-transparent, floats above screen
- **Confetti:** Joyful but professional, not over-the-top
- **Timing:** Let each element breathe - not too rushed

### 🎬 SEGMENT 4: REWARDS & RESULTS (21-28 seconds)

0:04-0:06 → Split screen: happy employee + HR dashboard
0:06-0:07 → Final logo reveal with tagline
```

#### Primary Veo 3 Prompt

```
An inspiring and cinematic corporate video finale. The scene opens with the digital passport from previous segment. In a beautiful magical transformation with particle effects and smooth morphing animation, the passport dissolves and reforms into:
- Floating gift cards in PassportCard branding
- Visual representations of bonuses (₪ symbols)
- Reward vouchers with orange and blue designs

A prominent points counter in large, bold numbers rapidly increases from 0 to 5,000 with satisfying odometer-style animation and subtle glow effects. Golden sparkles trail the counting numbers.

The frame elegantly splits into a professional split-screen composition:

LEFT SIDE (40% of frame): A genuine, happy professional employee - Israeli, age 30-35, business casual attire, modern office background. Natural smile, looking at their phone with satisfaction. Warm lighting, slightly blurred background suggesting premium office space.

RIGHT SIDE (60% of frame): A sophisticated HR analytics dashboard on a large monitor showing:
- Growing charts with upward trends
- Green checkmarks and positive metrics
- "ROI" visualization
- Success indicators in PassportCard colors
- All text in Hebrew with professional data viz design

Final 1.5 seconds: Both sides fade to white, PassportCard logo animates in from center with elegant particle burst. The tagline appears below in Hebrew: "גיוס שכיף" (Recruiting that's fun) in bold orange text.

Style: Premium corporate success story video, inspirational but authentic, professional color grading with warm undertones, smooth 60fps motion, cinematic shallow depth of field, high-end fintech commercial production quality. 4K resolution.
```

#### Alternative Prompt (Simplified)

```
Video starts with a digital passport that magically transforms into reward cards and money symbols floating in space with cool particle effects.

A big number counter increases quickly from 0 to 5000 with glowing animation.

The screen splits in half: LEFT shows a smiling professional person in office holding phone looking happy. RIGHT shows a computer screen with charts going up and positive metrics.

Everything fades to white and PassportCard logo appears in the center with the text "גיוס שכיף" underneath in orange.

Professional corporate video style. Inspiring and positive. Clean and modern. 1080p, 30fps.
```

## 5. Alternative Prompt Variations

### If Veo 3 struggles with Hebrew text:

**Solution:** Generate without text overlays, add text in post-production.

**Modified prompts:**
```
Same as above but: "minimal text on screen, focus on visual storytelling and UI interactions rather than readable text. Text areas show abstract placeholder content."
```

### If animations are too fast/slow:

**Add to prompt:**
```
"Pacing: slow and deliberate, allowing viewers to absorb each element. Each major action takes 1-2 seconds."
```

OR

```
"Dynamic and energetic pacing, quick transitions, engaging rhythm suitable for social media."
```

### If colors don't match brand:

**Add specific color codes:**
```
"Color palette strictly limited to: primary blue #0066CC, vibrant orange #FF6B35, white #FFFFFF, and accent gold #FFD700. No other colors used."
```

### For more dramatic effect:

**Add cinematic elements:**
```
"Shot on ARRI Alexa, cinematic depth of field, anamorphic lens flares, professional color grading with teal and orange color science, film grain texture."
```

## 12. Tips for Success with Veo 3

### Best Practices

**1. Iterative Generation**
- Generate 2-3 variations of each segment
- Select the best elements from each
- Don't expect perfection on first try

**2. Prompt Engineering**

**3. Consistency Across Segments**
- Use similar prompt structure for all 4
- Mention "continuing from previous segment" in later prompts
- Keep lighting and style keywords consistent

**4. Common Issues & Fixes**

**Issue:** Generated video is too generic
**Fix:** Add more specific brand details, colors, and style references

**Issue:** Text in video is unreadable
**Fix:** Generate without text, add in post-production

**Issue:** Pacing is wrong
**Fix:** Specify exact timing for each action in prompt

**Issue:** Colors don't match brand
**Fix:** Include exact hex codes and emphasize "strictly adhere to brand colors"

**Issue:** Too much motion/chaos
**Fix:** Add "smooth, controlled camera movement" and "professional pacing"
